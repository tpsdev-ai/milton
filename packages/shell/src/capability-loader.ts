// Capability loader — resolves an agent's `bob.yaml capabilities:` list against
// the blessed catalog, validates each capability's config block against its
// manifest's typebox schema, and composes the result into the pi session.
//
// HOW capabilities reach pi (the key design choice): each resolved capability's
// `piPackage` becomes an entry in pi's `DefaultResourceLoader`
// `additionalExtensionPaths`. That option routes through pi's package resolver
// (`resolveExtensionSources`), which accepts npm:/git:/local-path sources — it
// is the in-process / SDK-level equivalent of a `settings.json`
// `packages`/`extensions` entry. We use this rather than `createAgentSession`'s
// `customTools` (that's for Bob-authored *inline* tools, not capability
// *packages* that pi must load + lifecycle) and rather than writing a
// `settings.json` to disk (the embedded SDK path is configured via loader
// options, not a per-agent settings file). pi then owns tool exposure, hooks,
// and the extension lifecycle — no Bob-side tool/hook registry.
