// Bob's blessed capability catalog — the thin curation/trust layer pi doesn't
// ship (spec §4, decision "both"). An agent's `bob.yaml capabilities:` entries
// resolve against this map; only blessed names are allowed in the fleet, and
// this is the K&S gate for what capability packages an agent may load.
//
// pi owns the actual tool/hook *registry* — this is NOT that. It's a name →
// manifest lookup so Bob knows which pi package a capability resolves to and how
// to validate its config block, before handing the package to pi's loader.
//
// PR2 ships the MECHANISM. Only the `fixture` capability is implemented (it
// proves the loader). The real capabilities are listed as `notYetImplemented`
// so the catalog documents the intended fleet surface; resolving one is a hard
// error until its package lands in a later PR.
